## Introduction

Here's a list of review questions that I'll be covering in the lesson today, designed to help you think about whether you're following the process we're teaching:

- Did you write most of the code?
- Did you generally write just 1-2 lines of code per message, and ensure that every message outputs something useful?
- Had you always manually run the separate lines of code on your input before combining them into a function?
- Did you drive the solution process?
- Did you click "add a copy of message"?
- Did you redefine existing variables and functions in new messages?
- Did you edit outputs to make them just right?
- Did you follow [Polya's process](https://gist.github.com/jph00/d60301884c56fe063101a7cc6193b3af) and/or use any of his heuristics?

I'll also be discussing this style guide briefly today: [fastai coding style](https://docs.fast.ai/dev/style.html). And I'll be walking through <@748695865056821339>'s [solution to day 2a](https://gist.github.com/vishalbakshi/043e19119d29e14dfc11f8fb6abb96fa) because it's great!


@everyone: we now have a complete guide to the Solveit platform, both written and video versions. Thanks to @Kerem Turgutlu (AAI) and @Johnowhitaker for helping to make this happen! Some recent updates won't be included yet - we'll update the written version shortly.
